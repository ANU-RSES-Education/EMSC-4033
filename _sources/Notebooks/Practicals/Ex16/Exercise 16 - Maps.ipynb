    "# Exercise 16 - Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in geosciences research, we wish to produce maps displaying spatial data. Python provides two sets of tools for handling mapping: `Basemap` and `Cartopy`. `Basemap` is currently probably more popular, but its developers have announced that it will shortly be phased out in favour of `Cartopy`. We will therefore use `Cartopy` in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSES Jupyter server does not have Cartopy installed by default. You therefore need to install a copy for yourself. To do this, you need to run the following code in a Python cell:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "!conda install --yes --prefix {sys.prefix} cartopy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hopefully, your system will 'think' for a while and then display a message that the install has been successful. You only need to do this install procedure once; Cartopy will then be available for you to use in any Jupyter notebook. You can use a similar command to install any other package you may wish to use in future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once Cartopy is installed, you should be able to import it. We only need certain submodules from Cartopy; we will do\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cartopy.crs as ccrs\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second line here is, of course, just our familiar way of importing `matplotlib` for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, making a map is exactly the same as plotting in polar coordinates: we simply need to specify `projection=Projection()` when creating the plot. Here, `Projection()` is one of the Cartopy-supported [map projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection). For example,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax = plt.subplot(111,projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())\n",

If you only want to work with a subset of the globe, you can specify a different region (after creating the axes, but before doing any plotting) by removing `ax.set_global()` and instead calling `ax.set_extent((llon,rlon,llat,ulat))` where `llon` and `rlon` are the longitudes of the left- and right-hand sides of the region, and `llat` and `ulat` are the lower and upper latitudes of the region.

It seems this has to be inferred from the 'download' links on the Natural Earth website. The color options, `edgecolor` and `facecolor`, specify the colour used to draw outlines and fills; for some reason, it is necessary to pass the text string `'none'` (and not, as is more usual, the Python object `None`) if one does not want an object to be filled. Thus, for example, high-resolution rivers can be drawn by the command\n",

    "Because Cartopy is built as an add-on to `matplotlib.pyplot`, you can use all of the standard plotting tools to add data to your map. For example, point data and lines can be added using `plt.plot()`, contours can be drawn using `plt.contour()`, and gridded data using `plt.imshow()`. However, it is critically important that you include `transform = <something appropriate>` in each plotting command, to ensure that Cartopy correctly interprets the data you provide. For most common cases, where your data is expressed in terms of latitude and longitude, the most appropriate choice will be `transform=ccrs.Geodetic()`. When a geodetic coordinate system is used, using `plt.plot()` to draw a line between two points will result in a geodesic curve (the great-circle path representing the shortest distance on the surface of the spherical Earth). If you instead wish to draw a line that appears straight in the 2-D plane, you can use `transform=ccrs.PlateCarree()`.\n",
