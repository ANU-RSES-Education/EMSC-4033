    "# Python Phrase Book\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we should do is become familiar with the shape and feel of python code because we can't really discuss the features of python without a few examples. So here is a little phrase book ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Aside\n",
    "The Python name derives from *Monty Python's Flying Circus* which means you should be alarmed at the mention of a [Phrase Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1Sw0PDgHU4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obligatory Hello world program\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Print out the \"Hello World\" message\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no set up needed to run this simple example because the `print` command is built into python. \n",
    "It is actually implemented as a *function* that displays its argument to the screen, so now you know what python functions look like ! You can also see how to write a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of other ways to do the same thing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "hello_world_string = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(hello_world_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Formatting output is also possible (cf c `printf` formats)\n",
    "print(\"-- {:s} --\".format(hello_world_string))\n",

    "```\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign the message to a variable and print that directly. The `print` function does not need to be told that `hello_world_string` is a string (and the fact that the name has the word *string* in it is neither here nor there). Variable names are allowed to have underscore characters in them, letters and numbers (other than the first character, that can't be a number). underscores at the beginning of a variable are conventionally *\"hidden\"* which actually just means they are a bit harder to find in an interactive environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In fact, the string is a python object that understands that it may need to be printed and will respond appropriately to the print function's call. The `format` function is also part of the repertoire of the string object and we will see this `object.function` way of accessing the \"methods\" of an object very, very often.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the layout of a typical python code - the blocks that make up a loop or the branches of conditions are defined by the indentation. Easy if the code is short, much harder to follow if you cram too much into a block. \n",

    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Since `python` is an interpreted language, you must define functions before they are encountered in the code. That inverts the way many people write their code with the *subroutines* defined after the logic of the code is laid out. Instead, `python` uses *modules* to organise collections of code that are defined outside the main flow of the code. \n",

    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of `python` is probably in the way it encourages sharing and builds a community of users. Before we can do much with `python`, we generally need to `import` the *modules* with the extra functionality we need. The `print` function is unusual in not needing to be imported, nearly everything else we want to do needs an `import` first\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the standard python library comes with modules for basic file system operations, string manipulation, mathematical functions, spawning processes ... and so on. The full list is in the [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).
