    "## How to interpret the equations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are mathematically minded, then the groundwater flow equation by itself give you a really good feel for how the fluid works. You recognise a _diffusion equation_ and understand that it naturally comes about from a problem where the flux in some quantity is proportional to the gradient of this quantity. _(In this case, mass or volume flux is proportional to the pressure gradient. In the case of thermal diffusion, the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient)._  You also understand how the problem becomes more complicated when the material properties vary from place to place. \n",

    "For the less mathematically minded, remember that the Laplace equation above is the result of writing the rate of change of the pressure as a gradient of the flux. \n",

    "                        \n",
    "Here is a simple picture to help you visualise why the gradient of the flux controls the build up of pressure _(or temperature)_: the level of fluid builds up if the rate at which fluid enters the volume (_the mass flux_), \\\\(q_i\\\\), is larger than the rate at which fluid leaves the volume, \\\\(q_o\\\\). The values of the fluxes top / bottom in this case are only different if there is a gradient in the flux (a difference between the values at two points !). The greater the difference, the faster the pressure in the volume will change.\n",
