    "An important module (or, really, collection of modules) for scientists is NumPy ('Numerical Python'). This provides a wide range of tools and data structures for working with numerical data, and for implementing matrix-vector calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is conventional to use `import numpy as np` when importing NumPy. NumPy then provides a fairly comprehensive set of mathematical functions, including\n",
    "- `np.sin()`, `np.cos()`, `np.tan()` - Trigonometric functions\n",
    "- `np.arcsin()`, `np.arccos()`, `np.arctan()` - Inverse trigonometric functions\n",
    "- `np.arctan2()` - [Two-argument version of the inverse tangent function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) that returns value in the correct quadrant\n",
    "- `np.sinh()`, `np.cosh()`, `np.tanh()`, `np.arcsinh()`, `np.arccosh()`, `np.arctanh()` - Hyperbolic functions and their inverses\n",
    "- `np.exp()`, `np.log()` - Exponentiation and its inverse, the natural logarithm\n",
    "- `np.log10()` - Logarithm to base-10\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy also provides some mathematical constants, including `np.pi` and `np.e`."

    "However, the core feature of NumPy is the array data type. This allows us to create structured grids containing data, which can then be accessed, transformed and used efficiently. Where numerical data is to be stored or processed, a NumPy array is likely to be the most effective mechanism to use. There are two main ways to create an array. First, we can use the `np.array()` function, to build an array from a list (or similar):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = np.array([1,2,3])\n",
    "b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Second, we can use various functions that create 'standard' arrays:\n",
    "- `np.ones(dims)` - Array filled with elements equal to `1`\n",
    "- `np.zeros(dims)` - Array filled with elements equal to `0`\n",
    "- `np.eye(N)` - $N \\times N$ identity matrix (ones on diagonal, zero otherwise)\n",
    "- `np.arange(start,stop,step)` - Create ascending sequence of numbers from `start`, in intervals of `step`, finishing before `stop`. If only two (unlabelled) arguments are given, it is assumed that `step=1`. If only one argument is given, it is additionally assumed that `start=0`.\n",
    "- `np.linspace(start,stop,N)` - Create an array containing $N$ equally-spaced points, with the first one being at `start`, and the last being at `stop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `dims` is a list or tuple specifying the number of elements in each dimension of the array: for example,\n",
    "`np.ones([3])` creates a one-dimensional array, identical to `np.array([1,1,1])`, whereas `np.zeros([3,6,2,2,3])` creates a five-dimensional array filled with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the array-creation routines take an optional argument, `dtype=type`, where `type` is a string. This specifies the data type which can be stored in the array. For example, `np.ones([3,3],dtype='int')` creates an array of integer type, while `np.zeros([3,3],dtype='bool')` creates an array of Boolean (True/False) values, initialised to `False`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Array elements can be accessed using `[...]` and a (zero-based) index for each dimension, or `:` to denote all elements within that dimension: we can thus obtain arrays that are a subset of a larger array.\n",
