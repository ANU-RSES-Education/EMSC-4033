    "The starting point for any figure is to call `plt.figure()`. This creates a blank canvas, onto which you will subsequently draw whatever you wish to display. Most commonly, you will probably wish to plot some set of data, contained within an array (or list). This can be achieved by calling `plt.plot()`:\n",

    "- Color: specify `color=colorinfo`. `colorinfo` can be specficied in [a variety of different ways](https://matplotlib.org/users/colors.html), but most often you will probably want to use a color name. You can use any of the names from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) (ignoring any spaces or capitalisation), and any name from [this list](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/) (including spaces) prefaced by `xkcd:`. There are also single-letter shorthands for red (`'r'`), green (`'g'`), blue (`'b'`), cyan (`'c'`), yellow (`'y'`), magenta (`'m'`), black (`'k'`) and white(`'w'`). Some examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Line style: specify `linestyle=styleinfo`, where styleinfo is one of [various strings](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html) such as `'solid'`, `'dashed'`, `'dotted'`, and so on. Again, there are shorthands for the most common cases: `'-'`, `':'`, `'--'` and `'-.'`.\n",

For example, `plt.plot(x,y,'o')` plots data points as circles; `plt.plot(x,y,'r^')` plots red triangles. For more control over colors, one can specify options `markerfacecolor=colorinfo` and `markeredgecolor=colorinfo`.
