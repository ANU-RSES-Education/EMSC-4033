    "You should now know how to open files, read data tables from them using numpy, and write your outputs to new files.  Getting data in/out of Python is a routine task for data analysis, and people have put a lot of effort into making it as simple as possible. [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is one of the main data science modules, which specialises in handling 'spreadsheet'-type data - i.e. a data table with column and/or row labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical you'll learn the basics of reading and writing data using `pandas`, some basic data manipulation and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this practical, `pandas` has a [number of excellent tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html) focussed at beginners. There is also a chapter about `pandas` in the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html). If your work is based around spreadsheet-type data, we strongly recommend going through these tutorials in due course.\n",

    "## `pandas` basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The central concept of `pandas` is the `DataFrame`. This is a 2D table of data, with associated row and column labels - just like a spreadsheet. A `DataFrame` can be 'indexed' by row or column names - i.e. you use the row/column *labels*, instead of their numeric indices like you do in `numpy` arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` started as a convenient way to import and export labeled data, but has grown into something a lot more comprehensive, and now does basic statistics, plotting, time-series analysis, 'split-apply-combine' data grouping... and much more.\n",

    "So far, everything we've done can be achieved with equivalent convenience in `numpy`... so what's the point? The strength of `pandas` is in its use of data labels, so you can associate rows/columns with meaningful information, rather than numerical indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be really useful if, for example, you're working with a dataset that you add new columns to over time. If you were using numpy, the numeric indices of the columns of interest might change, and break your code. With `pandas`, your code will be fine as long as the labels of the columns stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assign some labels to your dataset. You can do this by setting the `columns` or `index` (rows) attributes of your dataframe with a list of strings whose length is equal to the number of columns or rows. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(...)\n",
    "df.columns=['Label_1', 'Label_2',...,'Label_N']\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should labels be?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call columns/rows whatever you like. A column name could be a whole paragraph, if you really wanted... but this is a really bad idea. You should use labels that are **unique**, **meaningful** and **concise**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `Temperature` isn't great - what are the units? What if you have Kelvin, Centigrade *and* Fahrenheit columns? `Temperature °C` is better, but will be cumbersome in routine use, because it's long, and has special characters and spaces in. `T_C` is ideal - it's nice and short, containing a commonly used abbreviation for temperature ('T'), and the unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus:** If your label names start with a letter and don't contain spaces or special characters, you can access them directly using the `.` operator, without needing to use `.loc[]`. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.Label_1\n",
    "df.loc[:, 'Label_1']\n",
    "```\n",
    "both produce return the same column, but `df.Label_1` brings the added benefit of having <kbd>Tab</kbd> auto-completion for your column names! This can be really convenient if, for example, you want to access columns during plotting.\n",
