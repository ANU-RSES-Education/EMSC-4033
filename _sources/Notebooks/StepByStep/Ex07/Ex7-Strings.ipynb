    "\n",
    "Until now, we have mainly been dealing with numeric data (numbers). However, it is often necessary to process text sequences, referred to as 'character strings'. In this exercise, we will see some of the mechanisms Python provides for text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already seen, any literal text sequence can be entered between a pair of inverted commas (\" \" or ' '), and stored to a variable. Python allows both single and double quotes to be used (not all languages do, so be careful if translating this sort of thinking to another language in the future). \n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Hamlet\"\n",
    "quote = 'To be or not to be: that is the question.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we look at `type(name)`, we see that Python has a `str` type to represent strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To join two strings together, we can simply combine them using the `+` operator:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = name+\" says \"+quote\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can enter quotation marks in a string literal by using the *other* kind of quotation mark as the string delimiter: either\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = name+\" says '\"+quote+\"'\"\n",
    "y = name+' says \"'+quote+'\"'\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "print(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also 'escape' the quotation mark, by placing a `\\` in front of it. This forces Python to treat it as a literal character, without any special meaning:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = name+\" says \\\"\"+quote+\"\\\"\"\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, we can use triple-quotes (\"\"\" \"\"\") to mark the beginning and end of the string, which allows ' and \" to appear within the string without difficulties:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "difficult = \"\"\" Apparently \"we can't just use single quotes\" around this string \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "We already encountered triple-quoted strings, in the context of docstrings at the start of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the multiplication operator to repeat a string multiple times:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = 3*name\n",
    "print(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, most other 'mathematical' operators (such as subtraction and division) have no meaning with strings.\n",

    "As with other data types, Python provides a number of functions to work with a string, `s`. Some of the more important ones are:\n",
    "- `len(s)` - Return the number of characters in `s`.\n",
    "- `s.count(x)` - Count the number of occurrences of string `x` within string `s`. Again, this is case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s.join(x)` - Here, `x` is assumed to be an iterable (typically a list or tuple) of strings. This function returns a single string, containing all the strings from `x` with a copy of `s` between each. For example, `':'.join(['a','b','c'])` will return `'a:b:c'`.\n",
    "- `s.split()` - Return a list of all of the 'words' (substrings separated by whitespace) within `s`. Optionally, provide a character to be regarded as the word separator. For example, `'a,b,c'.split(',')` will return `['a','b','c']`. It is also possible to specify the maximum number of words to be returned; once this limit is reached, no further splitting is performed. A variant `s.rsplit()` works backwards from the end of the string.\n",
    "- `s.replace(x,y)` - Return a version of `s` where every occurrence of string `x` is replaced by string `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s.find(x)` - Return the index of the start of the *first* occurrence of string `x` in string `s`. Note that this is case-sensitive: compare `quote.find('to')` with `quote.find('To')`. A variant `s.rfind(x)` finds the *last* occurrence of `x`. Variants `s.index()` and `s.rindex()` are almost identical, except that they have different behaviour if `x` cannot be found within `s`: whereas `s.find()` raises an error, `s.index()` returns `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s.upper()`, `s.lower()` and `s.title()` - Return a copy of the string `s` converted to be entirely in UPPER CASE/lower case/Title Case respectively.\n",
    "- `s.isupper()`, `s.islower()`, `s.istitle()` - Return `True` if `s` is entirely in UPPER CASE/lower case/Title Case respectively, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "- `s.capitalize()` - Return a version of `s` where the first character is in UPPER CASE and the remainder in lower case.\n",
    "- `s.swapcase()` - Return a version of `s` where all UPPER CASE characters are converted to lower case and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s.center(n)` - Create a string of length `n` containing a copy of `s` centered within this. By default, this is achived by padding with spaces (' ') before and after `s`; optionally, you can specify a different charater. For example, `'hello'.center(11, '_')` returns `'___hello___'`.\n",
    "- `s.ljust(n)` - Create a string of length `n` containing a copy of `s` at its left. Optionally, specify a character to use for padding. Similarly, `s.rjust(n)` places `s` at the right of the `n`-character string.\n",
    "- `s.strip()` - Return a copy of `s` with all whitespace removed. `s.lstrip()` and `s.rstrip()` are variants removing whitespace only at the start or end of the string, respectively. For example, `'elephant'.strip('e')` returns `'lephant'`. \n",

    "As you may have noticed, Python's `print` function often displays information to a large number of decimal places, and it does not generally produce nicely-formatted output.
