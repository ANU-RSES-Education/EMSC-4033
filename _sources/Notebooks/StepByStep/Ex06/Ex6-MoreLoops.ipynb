    "We have already encountered one way of repeating calculations - the `while` loop. Python also provides a second kind of loop, the `for` loop. This allows us to do a calculation for each of the entries in a list, tuple or dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a `for` loop takes the form:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for <variable> in <collection>:\n",
    "    [calculations using <variable>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "As with the `while` loop, everything within the indented block is executed multiple times, with the `<variable>` getting set equal to a different element of `<collection>` on each pass. `<collection>` may be any 'iterable', such as a list. For example, the following code would calculate the sum of all the entries in `a`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 5, 9]\n",
    "s = 0\n",
    "for x in a:\n",
    "    s += x\n",
    "    print(x, s)\n",
    "print(\"Total is:\", s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is possible to use `continue` and `break` statements within a `for` loop, just as in a `while` loop.\n",
