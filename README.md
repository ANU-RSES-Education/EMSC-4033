## Using Jupyterbook

This repository also contains the information for building a jupyterbook using the notebooks that are in
the Notebooks directory.

There is some additional configuration to make this work smoothly and you can read what needs to be done 
in [Jupyterbook/README.md](Jupyterbook/README.md)

For this example, you can see the [online version](https://ANU-RSES-Education.github.io/EMSC-4033/FrontPage.html) which is automatically built by github using this repository.
