    "Many physical, chemical and biological systems can be modelled using differential equations. Often, these do not have analytical solutions, but they can be solved numerically. There are many techniques for achieving this, and in this practical we will look only at a couple of simple examples.\n",

    "A simple pendulum of mass $m$, suspended from a string of length $l$, obeys the differential equation\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\frac{g}{l}\\sin\\theta = 0,$$\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is the angle the string makes with a vertical line. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use the function `scipy.integrate.odeint()`. This solves differential equations of the form\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = f(\\mathbf{y},t).$$\n",
    "We therefore first need to work out how to write the pendulum equation in this form. Fortunately, there is a standard approach we can follow. We define $$\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\theta(t)\\\\\\dot\\theta(t)\\end{array}\\right),$$\n",
    "where $$\\dot{\\theta}  = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{y}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\dot\\theta\\\\\\ddot\\theta\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}y_2(t)\\\\-\\frac{g}{l}\\sin y_1(t)\\end{array}\\right).$$\n",
    "Thus, given any vector $\\mathbf{y}$, we can compute its time derivative.\n",
