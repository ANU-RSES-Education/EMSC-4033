    "The starting point for any figure is to call `plt.figure()`. This creates a blank canvas, onto which you will subsequently draw whatever you wish to display. Most commonly, you will probably wish to plot some set of data, contained within an array (or list). This can be achieved by calling `plt.plot()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100) # 100 equally-spaced points\n",

    "We can control the properties of the line by specifying various additional arguments:\n",
    "- Color: specify `color=colorinfo`. `colorinfo` can be specficied in [a variety of different ways](https://matplotlib.org/users/colors.html), but most often you will probably want to use a color name. You can use any of the names from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) (ignoring any spaces or capitalisation), and any name from [this list](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/) (including spaces) prefaced by `xkcd:`. There are also single-letter shorthands for red (`'r'`), green (`'g'`), blue (`'b'`), cyan (`'c'`), yellow (`'y'`), magenta (`'m'`), black (`'k'`) and white(`'w'`). Some examples:\n",

    "    - `color='xkcd:boring green'`\n",
    "    - `color='r'`\n",

    "- Line width: specify `linewidth=width`, where width is measured in '[points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_%28typography%29)', for example `linewidth=3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line style: specify `linestyle=styleinfo`, where styleinfo is one of [various strings](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html) such as `'solid'`, `'dashed'`, `'dotted'`, and so on. Again, there are shorthands for the most common cases: `'-'`, `':'`, `'--'` and `'-.'`.\n",

    "For the simplest cases, where the shorthand forms for color and/or line style are appropriate, these can be combined and provided as a third, unlabelled argument to plot, e.g. `plt.plot(x, y, 'r:')` to plot a dotted red line.\n",

    "Sometimes, we may wish to plot individual data points with symbols, rather than a line joining them all together. This can be achieved by providing [a letter specifying which symbol to use](https://matplotlib.org/1.4.1/api/markers_api.html) as the third argument to `plt.plot()` (optionally preceded by a one-letter color shorthand). For example, `plt.plot(x, y, 'o')` plots data points as circles; `plt.plot(x, y, 'r^')` plots red triangles. For more control over colors, one can specify options `markerfacecolor=colorinfo` and `markeredgecolor=colorinfo`. If one wishes to have both markers *and* line, one can specify the selected symbol via `marker=markerletter`.\n",

Axes labels can be set by calling `plt.xticks(locations, labels)` where `locations` is a list of the x (or y) values you wish to annotate, and `labels` is the corresponding list of labels.
