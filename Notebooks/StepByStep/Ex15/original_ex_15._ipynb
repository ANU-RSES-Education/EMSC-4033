    "# Exercise 15 - More plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will meet some more advanced features of Python's plotting capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, you may want to put more than one 'panel' within a figure. For simple cases (where you are happy to have the panels arranged in an $N \\times M$ grid), you can use `plt.subplot()`. This has syntax\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.subplot(nrows, ncols, index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `nrows` is the number of 'rows' in the figure, `ncols` is the number of columns, and `index` is a number between 0 and `nrows*ncols - 1` which selects which of the panels we wish to work on currently. Typically, one will call `plt.subplot()` several times, with the same `nrows` and `ncols`, but a different `index` in each case. Having switched to a panel, we can then issue plotting commands for that panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a shorthand, if `nrows`, `ncols` and `index` are all single-digit numbers, you can also call `plt.subplot(nci)` where `nci` is `nrows`, `ncols` and `index` concatenated into a 3-digit number. In other words, `plt.subplot(3,2,5)` is exactly the same as `plt.subplot(325)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(12,3))\n",
    "xx = np.linspace(0,1,100)\n",
    "plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\n",
    "plt.plot(np.sin(5*np.pi*xx),'r')\n",
    "plt.subplot(122)\n",
    "plt.plot(np.cos(5*np.pi*xx),'b')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also notice here that we have passed `figsize = (xsize, ysize)` to `plt.figure()`, to control the size (and more importantly, shape) of the figure we have created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it out."

    "`plt.subplot()` allows us to have multiple axes within a single figure, and when we call it it returns an 'Axes' object. Using `plt.subplot()` also provides a convenient way to access and control various properties of the axis. For example, if we want to plot a graph in polar coordinates, we can call `plt.subplot(111,projection='polar')`. We can plot a spiral:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n=1000\n",

    "ax.set_rticks([])\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that we are now setting a variable `ax` to reference the set of axes produced by `plt.subplot()`, and this allows us to access functions like `ax.set_theta_zero_location()` and `ax.set_rticks()`. Can you work out what these do?"

    "If we wish to add text to a figure, we can call `plt.text(x,y,\"text string\")`. Here, `x` and `y` are the coordinates at which we want to place the text, expressed in the same units as our data. Sometimes, this can be an inconvenient coordinate system to use - for example, if we are trying to label our subplots as (a), (b), etc, we probably want the label to be in the same place on the plot regardless of how we rescale the axes. Matplotlib therefore provides us with access to a second coordinate system, such that the bottom left-hand corner of our axes corresponds to (0,0) and the top right-hand corner is (1,1). Most plotting commands can be issued against this coordinate system by passing `transform=ax.transAxes` as an optional argument to the command. For example,\n",

    "- The `plot` function is a method of the current axes, such that you can plot by calling `ax.plot()`. This is a good practice because it avoids confusion when having several Axes on a plot\n",
    "- The two text strings are both located at the point (0.5,0.25), but in different coordinate systems\n",
    "- In each case we plot a small 'x' at the same point, and notice that by default this corresponds to the bottom-left corner of our text string\n",
