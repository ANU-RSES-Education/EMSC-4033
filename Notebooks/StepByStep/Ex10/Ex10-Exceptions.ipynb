    "# Exercise 10 - Exception handling\n",
    "*Andrew Valentine, Louis Moresi, louis.moresi@anu.edu.au*\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you will almost certainly have encountered 'exceptions' - the error messages that appear when you ask Python to do something that it doesn't like. For example, the following code will raise an exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(a[4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attempting to execute this code results in some text similar to this:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-1-ba5ce40e4136> in <module>()\n",
    "      1 a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "----> 2 print(a[4])\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The error here is that we have tried to access the 5th element of `a` (remember, counting starts from zero!), but `a` only contains three entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example might be\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 1 + 'hello'\n",
    "```\n",
    "which generates\n",
    "```text\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-2-41d1b959c123> in <module>()\n",
    "----> 1 1 + 'hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that these two error messages have different headlines: the first is an `IndexError`, whereas the second is a `TypeError`. You will notice that a variety of other kinds of error exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these errors are simply coding mistakes, it is useful to have the program terminate immediately, so we can fix it. However, in 'real' code these sorts of problem may arise for reasons beyond the programmer's control - perhaps the user has provided an incorrect set of inputs, for example. It is therefore often useful to be able to 'catch' and 'handle' exceptions in a graceful manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, Python provides the `try... except...` construct. This looks like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    [code that may fail]\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    [code to handle the error]\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a `try...except...` construct is encountered, Python first attempts to execute all the code within the indented `try` block. If this is successful, the code within the `except` block is never executed. However, as soon as an error is encountered, Python stops attempting to execute the `try` block, and jumps immediately to the first line in the `except` block. It executes everything in the `except` block, and then (assuming no more errors arise) continues with the first line *after* the `try...except...` construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = float(input('Please enter a number: '))\n",
    "    print(\"The next number is: \", x+1)\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    print(\"Sorry, that is not a valid number\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "will gracefully handle cases where the user types text into the input field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**&#10148; Try it out!** Compare how Python behaves with, and without, the `try...except...` construct."

    "This kind of error handling is sometimes referred to as the 'EAFP' model: \"easier to ask forgiveness than permission\". Rather than attempting to verify that everything is correct *before* carrying out an operation - a process which can be tedious and computationally inefficient - we start by assuming everything will work, and then deal with any mess that we create.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `try... except...` statement above will handle *any* kind of error that might arise. This may seem superficially attractive, but it can lead to confusion. For example, suppose we had made a typo in our code, referring to a variable `z` (which doesn't exist):\n",

    "    print(\"Sorry, that is not a valid number\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, this will always complain that we have entered an invalid number - even though this is not the real problem. If we remove the `try... except...` we see that this code is triggerring a `NameError`, rather than the `ValueError` that we intended to avoid. If this were 'real' code, we might waste a lot of time trying to understand why Python thought we were entering invalid numbers.\n",
