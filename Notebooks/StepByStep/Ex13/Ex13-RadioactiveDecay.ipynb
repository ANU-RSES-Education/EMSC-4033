    "Unstable atomic nuclei may undergo radioactive decay, losing energy (and particles) via radiation. This is a random process, but one which can be quantified by the concept of 'half-life' or 'decay rate'. The half-life is the amount of time required for 50% of the atoms in an initially pure sample to decay. It is often represented by the symbol $t_{1/2}$, and is related to the decay rate, $\\lambda$, by the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret $\\lambda$ as being the probability that each nucleus will decay per unit time. We can also show that radioactive decay obeys the differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -N\\lambda $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if there are $N$ radioactive particles at time $t$, then we expect to see $N \\lambda \\Delta t$ of them decay in the (infinitesimal) time interval $\\Delta t$.\n",

    "Suppose you have a sample that is known to be pure, and contain N atoms of ${}^{219}$Rn at some time $t$. Provided $\\Delta t$ is small, you expect that at the time $t+\\Delta t$ you will have $N(1-\\lambda_{{}^{219}\\mathrm{Rn}}\\Delta t)$ atoms of ${}^{219}$Rn, and $N (\\lambda_{{}^{219}\\mathrm{Rn}}\\Delta t)$ atoms of  ${}^{215}\\mathrm{Po}$. The amount of each isotope within the sample is a balance between its production, and its decay.\n",

    "**&#10148; Write code to simulate the decay chain.** Starting with 10,000 ${}^{219}\\mathrm{Rn}$ particles, produce a graph of the amount of each isotope present at any point in time. (Since the halflife of ${}^{215}$Po is so short, we can neglect this step and treat the system as though ${}^{219}$Rn decays directly to ${}^{211}$Pb.)"
