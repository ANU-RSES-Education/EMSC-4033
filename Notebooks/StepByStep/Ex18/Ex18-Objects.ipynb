    "By now, you should be comfortable with the idea that variables have types, and often come with various functions and attributes 'attached' which can be accessed by using `<variablename>.<functionname>` or `<variablename>.<attributename>`. In this exercise, we will learn how we can implement our own data types and make use of this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the motivation for doing this will simply be ease of organisation. For example, suppose you have a collection of rock samples, and you wish to represent them in your program. You have various pieces of information about each rock in your collection, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An ID number;\n",
    "- The location at which it was collected;\n",
    "- A brief description of the rock type (e.g. 'Granite');\n",
    "- Various geochemical measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen various ways in which this information could be stored in a program, including tuples, dictionaries, and as a Pandas data frame. For many applications, these may be good choices. However, it is also possible to create a custom data type, which we will call `RockSample`, and encapsulate all the information about one physical rock within one Python 'object'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to write a `class definition`. This is an indented block beginning with the line `class <ClassName>:`, containing one or more functions. In particular, it will usually contain a function with the name `__init__`. This is the initialisation (or 'constructor') function, which gets called when we want to create a new 'instance' of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have a class definition:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class RockSample:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, idNumber, location, description, percentNickel=None, percentCopper=None):\n",
    "        self.idNumber = idNumber\n",
    "        self.location = location\n",
    "        self.description = description\n",
    "        self.percentNickel = percentNickel\n",
    "        self.percentCopper = percentCopper\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we can use this to create variables representing each of our physical rock samples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "r1 = RockSample(1, (-35.3,149.1), 'Heavily altered sandstone')\n",
    "r2 = RockSample(2, (-35.7, 148.9), 'Granite', percentCopper=0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that we use the class name as if it were a function, passing it the arguments required by `__init__()`. Now, we can access all our data as attributes of `r1` and `r2`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(r1.description)\n",
    "print(r2.percentNickel)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attributes can be redefined, as necessary:\n",

    "You have probably noticed that our `__init__()` function is defined as having four non-optional arguments, but when we call it to create a new variable, we only appear to pass three values to it.

Note that `__init__()` should *not* contain a `return` statement.\n",

For example, we might write a `plot_location()` function, to create a map showing where the sample was collected.\n",

    "What have we gained by doing this? One benefit lies in data organisation: by encapsulating information in this way, we ensure that all our data about a physical sample is kept together. We can easily pass the entire RockSample object to a function, ensuring that all information is accessible within that function. This becomes particularly useful when developing large, complex programs, where one might have something like\n",

By encapsulating everything within a class, we can write `function_a` and `function_b` without needing to think about what information `function_c` will be accessing. If we subsequently decide to change how `function_c` works, we can easily add new information to the class and access it inside `function_c`, without needing to make any modifications in `function_a` and `function_b`.\n",
