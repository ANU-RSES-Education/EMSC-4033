# Maps with the Cartopy Package

We will work through many of the interesting things that you can do with the `cartopy` package. You will need to understand numpy well, including the slicing notation, broadcasting of indices, and masking (e.g. indexing by boolean arrays). We will be grabbing data from online sources and from on-demand servers.
