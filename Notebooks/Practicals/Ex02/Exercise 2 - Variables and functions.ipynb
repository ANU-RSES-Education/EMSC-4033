    "### Naming Conventions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call your variables anything you like. However, following a few conventions will improve the clarity of your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your variable name is made up of multiple words, either:\n",
    "    - Join them using underscores (e.g. `a_long_variable_name = 17`), or\n",
    "    - Capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g. `anotherLongVariableName = 23.6`). This is sometimes referred to as 'camel case' (since it is lower case with extra humps!).\n",
    "- It is common to use UPPER CASE for constants that should never need to be changed within the program, e.g. `GRAVITATIONAL_ACCELERATION = 9.81`.\n",
    "- Traditionally, variables that contain integers have names beginning with the letters i, j, k, l, m, or n; variables containing real numbers start with any other letter. This comes from early programming languages (especially Fortran) where it was a requirement, and follows a similar convention in mathematics. Nowadays, this convention is often ignored for long variable names. However, if your name only contains one or two characters (e.g. `a` or `ix`), it is usual to choose the first letter appropriately. In particular, a bare `i`, `j`, `k`, `m` or `n` should only be used for a counting index (more on that later). If you ignore this rule, the program will work fine, but you can expect anyone who has to decipher your code in future to get very, very angry with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your code is connected to another document (e.g. you are trying to plot some equation from a paper) then use clearly-related names in both. For example, if your paper has the equation $y = \\alpha x +3\\gamma$, then use the variable names `x`, `y`, `alpha` and `gamma` in your code.\n",
    "- Make your variable names long enough to be clearly understood, but not *too* long. At most, you probably want it to be based on two or three words.\n",
    "- Do not give your variable a name that has a special meaning in Python (e.g. `int` or `sum`). Doing so will not *always* cause problems, but it is a common source of grief. Fortunately, most text editors (including the one that is part of Jupyter) will highlight these 'reserved words' in a different colour, so you can avoid using them. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3   # x is in black; I can use it for a variable name.\n",
    "sum = 5 # sum is in green: it has a special meaning and would be a bad choice for a variable name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, try and develop a consistent style, and name similar quantities in similar ways. For example, the following are individually all reasonable choices for variable names:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mass_of_helium = 4.003\n",
    "neon_mass = 20.180\n",
    "massArgon = 39.948\n",
    "mKrypton = 83.798\n",
    "mXe = 131.293\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, mixing the different styles within one program is guaranteed to cause you confusion and lead to errors. Pick one format that makes sense to you, and stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed, any variable has a **type**. We can ask Python to report on the type of a given variable by using the command `type(variable_name)`. For example,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3\n",
    "type(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print `int` (shorthand for 'integer'), while\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 3.0\n",
    "type(a)\n",

Other functions can be accessed by 'importing' them from 'modules' - we will learn more about this shortly.\n",

    "As we saw earlier, each variable we create has a type. Most variables come with certain functions and attributes 'attached' to them, to perform various operations that are commonly-required for that data type. These can be accessed using a 'dot':\n",

    "You may notice that some variables have a lot of attached functions that are named with double-underscores, such as `x.__add__()`. These are used by Python internally, and are not intended to be called directly in programs. In fact, the `__add__()` function is called whenever you use `+`: internally, `x+y` gets translated to `x.__add__(y)`. We will discuss this in more detail later in the course, when we talk about 'object-oriented programming'."
