This may seem like a waste of time - but you (or your colleagues) will be grateful in two years' time when you find you need to change something!

If you select a block of code and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (or on a Mac, <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd>), the selected lines will all be changed to begin with `#` comment characters. Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> again will restore the original version."
