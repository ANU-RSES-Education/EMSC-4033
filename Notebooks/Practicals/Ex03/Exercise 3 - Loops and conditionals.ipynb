    "Much of the power in programming comes from being able to repeat calculations, and/or change how our program works depending on the values of certain variables. To achieve this, we need to employ 'loop expressions' and 'conditional expressions'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional expressions allow us to alter the behaviour of our program depending on the circumstances. To do this, we employ an `if...elif...else` construct, which takes the form:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if <condition>:\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "elif <another condition>:\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, each `<condition>` is a 'logical' expression - something which is either 'true' or 'false'. Each `[...]` denotes a block of code that is only executed if the condition is met. We can have as many `elif` ('else if') blocks as we wish, and we can omit the `elif` and/or `else` blocks entirely. At most, one block will be executed: each is tried in the order they appear in the program, until one is found for which `<condition>` is `True`. Notice that the `else` block does not have a condition - this is executed if none of the other conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this clearer, here's a real example, inside a function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def condExample(x):\n",
    "    if x<0:\n",
    "        print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "    elif x<=1:\n",
    "        print(\"x is between 0 and 1 (inclusive)\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"x is greater than 1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**&#10148; Try it out!** Does everything behave as you would expect? Try deleting the `elif` and/or `else` clauses; how does this affect the output?"

    "### Logical expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical expressions are calculations that result in either `True` or `False`. As we have already seen, they often arise by comparing the value of two variables (or a variable and a constant), such as `x > 0`. The comparison operators are:\n",
    "\n",

    "|---|---|\n",
    "|`>` | Greater than|\n",

    "|`<=`| Less than or equal to|\n",
    "|`==`| Equal to|\n",
    "|`!=`| Not equal to|\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "3 > 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "should evaluate to `False`.\n",

    "Note: an important point is that the constants `True` or `False` are Booleans, and not text. So `\"True\"` (string) is very different of `True` (Boolean). A possible mistake is to confound them and use `\"True\"` instead of `True`. In general, as soon as you want to use something based on a true/false behavior, use Boolean constants in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build more complicated expressions, you can use the Boolean operators `and`, `or` and `not`. An expression of the form `A and B` is only `True` if both `A` and `B` are separately `True`. On the other hand, `A or B` is `True` if either (or both) of `A` and `B` are themselves `True`. The `not` operator flips `True` to `False`, and vice versa. You can use parentheses to group expressions if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x > 3 and (y == 2 or not (y > 3 and x+y ==4) )\n",
    "```\n",
    "Many logical conditions can be expressed in multiple forms, for example `x > 3` is identical to `not x <= 3`. In general, you should use the simplest form that is appropriate to your circumstances. \n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. In some other languages, the symbols `&` and `|` are used for `and` and `or`. In Python, these symbols are 'bitwise' operators, and they will not give the results you expect. We will avoid using them in this course.\n",

    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow you to repeat a series of calculations a number of times, or until certain conditions are met. In Python, there are two main loop formats. The first is a `while` loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while <condition>:\n",
    "    [...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `<condition>` is a logical expression (just like those discussed above). If this evaluates to `True`, the block of code (`[...]`) is executed in its entirety. The condition is then evaluated again, and the entire process repeats until it becomes `False`. For example, here is a loop that keeps doubling a number until it exceeds some threshold:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "while x<100:\n",
    "    x+=x\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Normally, the entire indented block of code below the `while` statement is executed before the condition is checked again. However, two commands can be used to alter this:\n",
    "- The `break` keyword terminates the loop, jumping to the first statement *after* the indented block\n",
    "- The `continue` keyword skips over any remaining code within the indented block, but returns to re-evaluate the `<condition>`, and if this is True will execute the indented block as before.\n",
    "These two commands are almost invariably used in conjunction with an `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "while x < 100:\n",
    "    x+=5\n",
    "    if x == 71: break\n",
    "    if x%2==0: continue # Skip even x\n",
    "    print(\"In loop: x=\",x)\n",
    "print(\"After loop: x=\",x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you run this code, you will see that it never prints an even number (since the print statement is after the `continue` in this case, and so doesn't get executed); moreover, the loop terminates at `x=71`, due to the `break` statement."

In Jupyter notebooks, this is the stop button, and in a terminal the ctrl+c command (for all operating systems). Infinite loops will run endlessly if not manually stopped (by sending a termination signal), and are a well known problem since the dawn of computer programming. Nowaday, it is not such a big deal but old systems used to froze when running such loops... So be careful and always check that your loop is not infinite!"
